#Fill out this short assignment using your own knowledge. Please feel free to consult our lecture notes and code or ask us for help.    
  
#Question 1:
  #Briefly describe the purpose of the following code line:
  head(mtcars)
  #The purpose of the code line is to obtain the first few observations of a dataset with all relevant variables
  #Where head() is the function and mtcars is the dataset

#Question 2:
  #Write a line of code that repeats the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10] four times
  rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10), times= 4)
  rep(c(1:5, 8:10), times =4)
  
#Question 3:
  #Produce a set of summary statistics for the "mpg" variable in the "mtcars" dataset 
  #hint: the "mtcars" dataset is hidden, but can be called like any other object in R:
  summary(mtcars$mpg)

#Question 4: 
  #Why does the following code not compile?
my_full_name <- c("Bob""Smith")
#You need a comma, so it needs to look like this:
my_full_name <- c("Bob", "Smith")
